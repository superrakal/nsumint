  "readme": "# broccoli-filter\n\nHelper base class for Broccoli plugins that map input files into output files\none-to-one.\n\nDocumentation to follow.\n\n### Upgrading from 0.1.x to 0.2.x\n\nYou must now call the base class constructor. For example:\n\n```js\n// broccoli-filter 0.1.x:\nfunction MyPlugin(inputTree) {\n  this.inputTree = inputTree;\n}\n\n// broccoli-filter 0.2.x:\nfunction MyPlugin(inputNode) {\n  Filter.call(this, inputNode);\n}\n```\n\nNote that \"node\" is simply new terminology for \"tree\".\n\n### Source Maps\n\n**Can this help with compilers that are almost 1:1, like a minifier that takes\na `.js` and `.js.map` file and outputs a `.js` and `.js.map` file?**\n\nNot at the moment. I don't know yet how to implement this and still have the\nAPI look beautiful. We also have to make sure that caching works correctly, as\nwe have to invalidate if either the `.js` or the `.js.map` file changes. My\nplan is to write a source-map-aware uglifier plugin to understand this use\ncase better, and then extract common code back into this `Filter` base class.\n",

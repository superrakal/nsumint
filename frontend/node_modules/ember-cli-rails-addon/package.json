This addon is\nresponsible for the following\n\n- Setting expected build variables without the user having to manipulate their\n  EmberCLI app's `Brocfile`\n- Creating lockfiles that `ember-cli-rails` tracks to ensure that requests halt\n  until EmberCLI has had a chance to fully build\n- Write build errors to a file so that `ember-cli-rails` can display them\n  properly\n",

  "readme": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/machty/emblem.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/machty/emblem.js)\n\n# Emblem.js\n\nEmblem.js is an indentation-based templating language that prints\n[Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)\ntemplates. Specifically, it targets [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)\ntemplates.\n\nEmblem's syntax most closely resembles that of the\n[Slim templating language](http://slim-lang.com/). Please see the\n[Emblem docs site](http://www.emblemjs.com) for a full explanation\nof the syntax, and check out [Try Emblem](http://bantic.github.io/try-emblem/).\n\nAlso check out the\n[Embercast on Emblem.js](http://www.embercasts.com/episodes/2)\n\n### Installation with Ember-CLI\n\nTo use Emblem with [Ember-CLI](http://ember-cli.com/), use the [ember-cli-emblem](https://github.com/Vestorly/ember-cli-emblem)\naddon.\n\n### Handlebars Version Dependencies\n\nAs of Emblem 0.5.0, the compiler is really a template printer. Previous\nversions compiled to Handlebars AST nodes and were forced to target\nspecific versions of Handlebars. The move to printing has eliminated that\nrestriction, and Emblem 0.5.0 should be compatible with any version\nof Handlebars.\n\nFor posterity, here is a history of Emblem and Handelbars compatibility\nacross revisions.\n\n- HTMLBars: Emblem 0.5.0+\n- Handlebars 2.0.0: Use Emblem ~0.4.0, or 0.5.0+\n- Handlebars 1.0.0: Use Emblem ~0.3.0, or 0.5.0+\n- Handlebars <= 1.0.0.rc4: Use Emblem <= 0.2.9, or 0.5.0+\n\n### Query params\n\nEmblem uses the following syntax:\n`= link-to 'index' (query-params foo=\"wat\")`\n\n[Ember query params documentation](http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/query-params/)\n\n### Syntax Examples\n\n- [Read the syntax documentation](http://www.emblemjs.com/syntax).\n- [Watch the Embercast](http://www.embercasts.com/episodes/2)\n- [Check out this JSBin.](http://jsbin.com/ulegec/337/edit)\n- Check out this [demo](http://emblem-test.herokuapp.com/) of\n  an [ember-rails](https://github.com/machty/ember-rails) site\n  with Emblem enabled.\n\n![Emblem.js Syntax](https://s3.amazonaws.com/machty/emblem-sample.png)\n\n### Using Emblem in your application\n\nPrevious versions of Emblem have supported a \"vanilla\" Handlebars\nmode. The intent was that Ember-specific helpers could be avoided.\n\nEmblem 0.5.0 dropped support for vanilla template compilation, but\nwe would like to bring it back. Please refer to\n[VANILLA_HANDLEBARS.md](https://github.com/machty/emblem.js/blob/43f1557f034893ce1d77bceb79c8f1ffadae0f7d/VANILLA_HANDLEBARS.md)\nfor more context.\n\n### Compiling in the Browser\n\nFor pre-0.5.0, follow the pattern in [this JSBin](http://jsbin.com/ulegec/337/edit):\n\n1. Include Handlebars\n2. Include Emblem\n3. Include Ember\n\nA globals build of Emblem appropriate for JSBins should be completed\nbefore 0.5.1 is released. See [#212](https://github.com/machty/emblem.js/issues/212).\n\n### Via Rails 3.1+\n\nFor pre-0.5.0, add the following to your Gemfile:\n\n```\ngem 'emblem-rails'\n```\n\n`emblem-rails` presently depends on `ember-rails`. With these\ntwo gems, any templates ending in `.emblem` will be (pre)compiled\nwith Emblem.js.\n\nAlso, check out the [demo app](https://github.com/machty/emblem-rails-demo)\nwhich uses the above configuration.\n\nUpdates to Emblem syntax do not require an update to `emblem-rails`. To\nupdate to the latest Emblem, you can run:\n\n```\nbundle update emblem-source\n```\n\n### Emblem Build Tools\n\nCompatible with 0.5.0+:\n\n1. [ember-cli-emblem](https://github.com/Vestorly/ember-cli-emblem)\n2. [gulp-emblem-printer](https://github.com/kay-is/gulp-emblem-printer)\n\nCompatible with pre-0.5.0:\n\n1. [emblem-rails](https://github.com/alexspeller/emblem-rails)\n2. [barber-emblem](https://github.com/machty/barber-emblem), a\n   Precompilation library for Ruby (used in `ember-rails`)\n3. [emblem-brunch](https://github.com/machty/emblem-brunch), Emblem\n   support for Brunch.io\n4. [Mimosa (support for Emblem since v 0.10.1)](https://github.com/dbashford/mimosa)\n5. [grunt-emblem](https://github.com/wordofchristian/grunt-emblem), Emblem support for Grunt (and Yeoman)\n6. [gulp-emblem](https://github.com/Aulito/gulp-emblem), Emblem support for gulp\n\n### Building Emblem.js\n\nClone the repo, then run:\n\n```\nnpm install\nbower install\nember build -e production\n```\n\nTo run tests in the browser, run:\n\n```\nbroccoli serve\n```\n\nThe tests will be available at http://localhost:4200/tests/.\n\nTo run tests in Phantom and Node (which is how CI runs), use:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n### Syntax Highlighting\n\nCheck out [vim-emblem](https://github.com/heartsentwined/vim-emblem)\nfor Vim editor support for Emblem.\n\nOtherwise, for now, please refer to syntax highlighting solutions for\n[Slim](http://slim-lang.com/), which is not much different\nfrom Ember's. At some point, we'll have something even more\ncustom tailored to Emblem (feel free to take a swing at it\nand send in a PR).\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\nIf you find a bug in Emblem syntax, please try to reproduce it in\nits simplest form with\n[this JSBin](http://jsbin.com/ucanam/4144/edit) before reporting an\nissue, which will help me nail down the source of the issue.\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/machty/emblem.js/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n\n*Emblem was authored and released by [Alex Matchneer](http://github.com/machty/) ([@machty](https://twitter.com/machty)).*\n\n<a href=\"http://vestorly.github.io/\">\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets-vestorly/vestorly-50px-height_360.png\" height=\"50\" width=\"169\" />\n</a>\n\n*The Emblem 0.5.0 release was generously funded by Vestorly.

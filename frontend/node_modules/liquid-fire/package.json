  "readme": "Liquid Fire\n===========\n\nComprehensive animation support for ambitious Ember applications. [Interactive Documentation is here](http://ef4.github.io/liquid-fire).\n\n## Features\n\n- Animated transitions between routes that work seamlessly with the\n  Ember router.\n\n- A DSL for laying out your spatial route relationships, cleanly\n  separated from view-layer implementation details.\n\n- Animated transitions between models within a single route.\n\n- Animated transitions between individual scalar values within a\n  template.\n\n- Promise-driven API to control your animation flow.\n\n- Backed by velocity.js, but easy to extend to other animation drivers\n  if there's interest.\n  \n\n## Installation\n\nThis is an ember-cli addon, so all you need is:\n\n    npm install --save-dev liquid-fire\n\n\n### Documentation \n\nLiquid Fire itself is an ember-cli application that runs an\ninteractive demo & documentation. [The docs are here](http://ef4.github.io/liquid-fire).\n\nYou can also see some examples in my [Ember Animation Demo](http://github.com/ef4/ember-animation-demo) repo, and this [video presentation from the Boston Ember Meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4M78SO3gAc).\n\n## Development\n\n### Source Organization\n\nThis repo contains both the liquid-fire library and a demo application\nthat presents interactive documentation. It follows standard ember-cli\naddon format.\n\n - app: is code that's loaded directly into the user's application\n - addon: is code that can be imported by the user from the `liquid-fire` namespace\n - tests/dummy: is the testing, demo, and documentation application that runs at http://ef4.github.com/liquid-fire\n - packaging: extra tooling for building non-ember-cli releases\n\n### Selecting Ember Versions\n\nLiquid Fire is tested against release, beta, canary, and canary +\nHTMLbars versions of Ember. While developing Liquid Fire, you can\nswitch to a different Ember environment by using the\n`packaging/select-ember-version.js` script in conjunction with\nthe environment variables used within the `env.matrix` section of\n`.travis.yml`, e.g.:\n\n    # switch to Ember Canary with HTMLbars enabled\n    $ EMBER_CHANNEL=canary HTMLBARS=true packaging/select-ember-version.js\n\nAfter running this command and re-running `ember serve`, the ember-cli\nserver (and QUnit test suite) will be running against Ember Canary +\nHTMLBars.\n\n\n",

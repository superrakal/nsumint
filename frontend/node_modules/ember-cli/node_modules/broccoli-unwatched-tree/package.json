  "readme": "## Broccoli Unwatched Tree\n\nThis is useful if you would like to use a given directory, but not have it polled/watched when running\n`broccoli serve` (or `ember server` if using Ember CLI).\n\nOriginally implemented by @joliss in `broccoli-bower` (see [here](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-bower/blob/ea0eec5c5fa736dc3744f3a7bb0b304b7ac9976e/index.js#L10-L12)).\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use the `vendor/` directory as a tree, but not watch its contents for changes do the following:\n\n```\nvar vendorTree = new UnwatchedTree('vendor');\n```\n\nYou can continue to use this tree just like any of the others, but due to the way it is implemented\nthe standard Broccoli::Watcher class will not check it for file changes.\n",

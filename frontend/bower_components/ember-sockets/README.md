Socket.io (WebSockets) integrated with Ember.js' observer pattern.

Example
------------

Install EmberSockets:

 * `npm install`;
 * `bower install`;
 * `grunt build`;

You need Node.js installed to use the example.

If you have it installed, you can simply run `node example/server.js` and then open the file `example/index.html` with your web-browser.

Getting Started
------------

First of all you need to bootstrap the module, which is done very much the same way that `Ember.DS` and `Ember.Router` go about it.

In your `Ember.Application` you need to configure EmberSockets by defining the host (default is `nsumint.ru`), the port (default is `80`) and the controllers capable of responding to WebSocket events.

```javascript
window.App = Ember.Application.create({

    Socket: EmberSockets.extend({
        host: 'nsumint.ru',
        port: 8888,
        controllers: ['cats', 'dogs', 'rabbits']
    })

});
```

In the above configuration, we'll be attempting to connect to `nsumint.ru` on port `8888`. Only three controllers will be able to respond to WebSocket events: `CatsController`, `DogsController`, and the `RabbitsController`. If you'd like the connection to occur automatically, you can set `autoConnect: true`.

To begin responding to events, you need to create a map of events to their properties. When the event is invoked the property will be updated with the response.

Since the release of Ember 1.0, you have been encouraged to place your actions into the `actions` hash on each controller &ndash; EmberSockets works in a similar way by defining the `sockets` hash.

```javascript
sockets: {
    cherryPickedName: 'name',

    // support multi words event name also
    'cherry picked name': 'name'
}
```

From this we can deduce that whenever the `cherryPickedName` event has been invoked, the `name` property on the controller will be updated with the event's data.

As the properties are all updated with the typical `Ember.get`, all computed properties and observers will work as usual.

```html
<section>Your name is {{name}}!</section>
```

If you would like to `emit` an event, you can use the `this.socket.emit` method from **any** controller &ndash; passing in the event name followed by any options.

<h3>Dereferencing</h3>

EmberSockets also allows you to specify an array of properties to update with a corresponding value. For example, if your backend responds with a name and age, then you'll want to specify an array of those two distinct properties to update.

```javascript
sockets: {
    person: ['name', 'age']
}
```

<h3>Supplying a function</h3>

You may not wish to simply update a property based on the received data, in these cases you can specify a method to invoke when the event occurs. When the callback is invoked, `this` is preserved for your controller, and the event data is passed through as the arguments.

```javascript
cherryPickedName: function(name) {
    this.set('name', name);
}
```

Using autoConnect=false
------------
Defer the connection by setting autoConnect to false.

```javascript
$window.App = Ember.Application.create({

  Socket: EmberSockets.extend({
    controllers: ['index'],
    autoConnect: false
  })

});
```

And then in your controller â€“ such as your ApplicationController, manually connect to the WebSockets server using the connect method, passing in any params into the connect method:

```javascript
this.socket.connect({
  query: { token: 123 }
});
```

Also, if you'd like to connect using a socket.io namespace
```javascript
this.socket.connect({
  namespace: '/my-namespace'
});
```

Ember-cli Adapter Example
------------
In **example/app/adapters/application.js** you will find an **ember-data** socket adapter for Models in ember-cli. To use simply copy this to into your Apps file structure in **app/adapters/application.js**.

By default all Models will try and get data from the ember-sockets connection.

<h4>NodeJS/Express Server Side example code snippet</h4>

```javascript

    socket.on('findAll', function(data, callback) {
		console.log('['+nsp+']' + " | findall: ", data);
		console.log('['+nsp+']' + " typeof: ", typeof callback);
		var _this = this;
		var dataOut = {};
		/*
		* Put all your database lookups in here....
		*/
		switch(data.type) {
			case'message': 	getMessages(data.query, callback); 	break;
			case'user':		getUsers(data.query, callback);		break;
		}

	});

	socket.on('find', function(data, callback) {
			console.log('['+nsp+']' + "-------DB-------");
			console.log('['+nsp+']' + " | find: ", data);
			console.log('['+nsp+']' + " typeof: ", typeof callback);

			var dataOut = {status: true, content: [{test:'test'}]};

			if(typeof callback === 'function') callback(dataOut);
	});

	// then the functions to collect & return the actual data
	getMessages = function(query, cb) {
		var dataOut = {status: true, content: [{
	        id: 1,
	        text: "Hello You There?",
	        sender: "David Bazan",
	        time: 'now',
	        user: 1
	    	},
	    	{
			id: 2,
			text: "Huh? what time is it?",
			sender: "Bon Iver",
			time: 'yesterday',
			user: 2
		}]
		};
		if(typeof cb === 'function') cb(dataOut);
	};

	getUsers = function(query, cb) {
		var dataOut = {status: true, content: [{
		        id: 1,
		        name: "Paul",
		        img: "/assets/img/profiles/d.jpg"
	    	},
	    	{
	    		id: 2,
		        name: "Paul2",
		        img: "/assets/img/profiles/d.jpg"
	    	}]
		};
		if(typeof cb === 'function') cb(dataOut);
	};
```
